          Hello, my name is Minjeong Kim, and I am originally from South Korea. Currently, I am in Australia on a Working Holiday Visa, gaining diverse experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
        Before coming to Australia, I worked as a Backend Software Engineer in Japan for a large-scale enterprise. My primary responsibility was to develop and integrate API communication systems that connected backend systems with various frontend platforms and databases. I was involved in both service-driven development and later transitioned into a system architecture role, where I planned and designed the structure for new services. My main tech stack included Java, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

          However, my original motivation for entering the software industry was to create user-friendly and visually engaging digital experiences. I have always enjoyed organizing information and designing templates for effective digital note-taking, which eventually led me to explore frontend development. While backend engineering primarily focuses on system-to-system interactions, I find frontend development more aligned with my passion for creating intuitive and interactive experiences for users.

          Currently, I am self-studying frontend development and actively working towards a career transition in this field. I am eager to apply my technical background and problem-solving skills to build engaging, user-centric applications.
